Hi I'm Josh Kohler a Big Lake,Minnesota Native with a passionate for Massage Therapy. I Attented Augusburg College in the twin Cities and graduated as a Excercise Science Major. 

I recently received my massage license in 2022, and have more than a decade of service industry experience. I I started my career as a world cass bar tender with an impeccable eye for details. I quickly transition into my passion of massage therapy and commited to getting education. After Graduating i started my business "Pura Vida", my dream is to have a a large spa someday. Currently I work with all clients, but specialize in those dealing with stress & anxiety and endurance athletes.I know every client is unique and so every treatment plan will be too. I have been continually adding skills to my repertoire to best assist my clients. While deep tissue massage is my specialty I am also happy to tone the pressure down with Swedish or take your relief to the next level with cupping therapy.

Let me help identify the source of your discomfort and provide recommendations which included tactics for both short-term and long-term relief. You can choose both massage and stretching, or stick to one modality. Your choice based on how you feel. 

My goal is focusing on helping people improve their quality of life. I love helping to create more balance and harmony in peoples lives by using my skills and intuition. It feels very rewarding to create a sense of relaxation and peace for others who are needing it. Its an honor to serve in this way.

donâ€™t hesitate to inquire!
